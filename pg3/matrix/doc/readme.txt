matrix - a library for vector and matrix computations

Attention! This library is incomplete: the eigenvalue and eigenvector
functions for non-symmetric matrices (file ../src/matrix3.c) are still
missing.

This library comes with four programs, namly transp, invert, solve,
and eigen which can be used to transpose a matrix, to invert a matrix,
to solve a linear equation system, and to compute the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix, respectively.  A brief explanation
of how to use these programs can be found in the file ../ex/readme.
For a list of options, call them without any arguments.

Enjoy,
